# ED-BH-chain
An exact diagonalization practice for a Bose-Hubbard chain.

The program is now computing the condensate fraction.

BasicBH.m----------main program

search.m----------bi-search code

condFrac----------compute the condensate fraction

You need to modify the limit of the length M in BasicBH.m by changing Min and Max. But take care not to let Max large than 14 unless you have a SUPERCOMPUTER, or it may take more than one day to run. Of course, maybe my computer is too WEAK.

Welcome for communication.
